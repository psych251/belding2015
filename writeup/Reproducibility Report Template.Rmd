<!-- Reproducibility reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects. These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

<!-- [No abstract is needed.]  Each reproducibility project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and reproducibility results. These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of your attempt to reproduce the results. Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for your reproducibility attempt, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  -->

<!-- **Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do. -->

### Justification for choice of study

I selected this study for two reasons:

1. My research interest is in education and technology, and many edtech systems rely on the ability of technology to give immediate feedback to learners. Therefore, the subject of feedback from a psychological perspective is relevant to my research.

2. Study 3A was conducted online with crowdworkers and all the materials appear to be available either in appendices or in supplementary materials. The experiment also seems relatively straightforward to set up and deploy.

### Overview of procedure and anticipated challenges

Participants will be randomly assigned into two groups. Each group will be given a different construal manipulation task: the "high construal" group will be asked to list reasons *why* they should improve their health, while the "low construal" group will be asked to concrete ways *how* they can improve their health. 

Next, participants will be asked to read one of two versions of a message about skin cancer and skin health (also determined randomly). One version of the message ("high changeability") will explain that skin cancer risk is the result of changeable behaviors, while the other ("low changeability") will suggest that skin cancer risk is due to unchangeable traits.

Finally, participants will be given several questions that assess their reaction to the skin cancer message.

Because of the 2x2 setup of the conditions in this experiment, there is the risk that I may not be able to get a large enough sample size to see signficant results. If this is the case, then I will need to simplify the experiment to test just one manipulation.

## Methods

### Description of the steps required to reproduce the results

Please describe all the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. 

### Differences from original study

Explicitly describe known differences in the analysis pipeline between the original paper and yours (e.g., computing environment). The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences may occur. Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to influence your ability to reproduce the original results.

### Measure of success

Please describe the outcome measure for the success or failure of your reproduction and how this outcome will be computed.


### Pipeline progress

Earlier in this report, you described the steps necessary to reproduce the key result(s) of this study. Please describe your progress on each of these steps (e.g., data preprocessing, model fitting, model evaluation).


## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Key analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Reproduction Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the key analysis and assess whether you successfully reproduced it, partially reproduced it, or failed to reproduce it.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis of the dataset, (b) assessment of the meaning of the successful or unsuccessful reproducibility attempt - e.g., for a failure to reproduce the original findings, are the differences between original and present analyses ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the reproducibility attempt (if you contacted them).  None of these need to be long.
